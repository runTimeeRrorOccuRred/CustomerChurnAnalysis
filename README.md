# Customer Churn Analysis (SQL • Python • Power BI)

This project analyzes customer churn using SQL, Python (EDA), and Power BI. It explores churn patterns, identifies high-risk customer segments, and presents insights through interactive dashboards. The dataset contains 7,000+ customer records with demographic details, service usage, and billing information.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to understand what drives customers to leave by studying their service usage patterns and profile characteristics.
By analyzing factors such as contract duration, monthly spending, total billing history, internet and phone activity levels, and the availability of support services like tech support and device protection, this project uncovers which customer groups are most at risk of churn.
Using SQL, Python EDA, and Power BI visuals, the aim is to highlight the key indicators of churn and provide insights that can help improve customer retention.
